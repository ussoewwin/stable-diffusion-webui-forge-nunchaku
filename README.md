## Models

### Nunchaku SDXL Models

Nunchaku SDXL models are available from the following repository:

- **[Nunchaku-R128-SDXL-Series](https://huggingface.co/ussoewwin/Nunchaku-R128-SDXL-Series)**  
  High-fidelity 4-bit quantized SDXL models optimized using Nunchaku (SVDQ W4A4) engine with Rank 128 (r128) for maximum quality preservation.

**Installation:**
1. Download the `.safetensors` files from the repository
2. Place them in `models/Stable-diffusion/` directory
3. The models will be automatically detected and loaded
