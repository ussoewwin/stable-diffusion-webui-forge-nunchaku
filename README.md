## Models

### Nunchaku SDXL Models

Nunchaku SDXL models are available from the following repository:

- **[Nunchaku-R128-SDXL-Series](https://huggingface.co/ussoewwin/Nunchaku-R128-SDXL-Series)**  
  High-fidelity 4-bit quantized SDXL models optimized using Nunchaku (SVDQ W4A4) engine with Rank 128 (r128) for maximum quality preservation.

**Installation:**
1. Download the `.safetensors` files from the repository
2. Place them in `models/Stable-diffusion/` directory
3. The models will be automatically detected and loaded

## Known Limitations

### LoRA Format Support for Nunchaku Models

**⚠️ Important:** The following limitations apply **only to Nunchaku quantization models** (Nunchaku Qwen Image, Nunchaku Z-Image, Nunchaku SDXL). Standard (non-quantized) models may support additional LoRA formats.

### LoKR (Lycoris) LoRA Support

**Status:** ❌ Not Supported for Nunchaku Models

**Issue:** LoRAs in LoKR format (created by Lycoris) are not supported for Nunchaku quantization models.

**Note:** LoKR format LoRAs may work with standard (non-quantized) Qwen Image, Z-Image, or SDXL models, but this implementation is designed specifically for Nunchaku quantization models.

⚠️ **Development History:** We have spent considerable time analyzing the internal structure of LoKR format and performing extensive mapping tests. Despite these efforts, we have not been able to find a successful way to apply LoKR weights to Nunchaku quantization models. The experimental conversion code has been tested but ultimately disabled due to incompatibility issues.

- LoKR weights are automatically skipped when detected for Nunchaku models (experimental conversion code is disabled).
- Converting to Standard LoRA using SVD approximation (via external tools or scripts) has also been tested and found to result in noise/artifacts when applied to Nunchaku quantization models.

**Conclusion:** At this time, we have not found a way to successfully apply LoKR weights to Nunchaku models. Please use Standard LoRA formats for Nunchaku models.

### Supported LoRA Formats for Nunchaku Models

**✅ Standard LoRA (Rank-Decomposed):**

Supported weight keys:
- `lora_up.weight` / `lora_down.weight`
- `lora.up.weight` / `lora.down.weight`
- `lora_A.weight` / `lora_B.weight`
- `lora.A.weight` / `lora.B.weight`

These are the standard formats produced by Kohya-ss, Diffusers, and most training scripts.

**❌ LoKR (Lycoris):** Not supported for Nunchaku models (Keys like `lokr_w1`, `lokr_w2`)

**❌ LoHa:** Not supported for Nunchaku models (Keys like `hada_w1`, `hada_w2`)

**❌ IA3:** Not supported for Nunchaku models
